My attempts at automated altcoin trading

## Please note:
It is important to get the target wallet address correct, not only in that the wallet string exists, but that 
it's also the same type of crypto currency. I've already wasted just over $2 when I sent Reddcoin into a Litecoin wallet on
accident.

## Also note:
I'm not an expert, this is code that you should not trust/use without looking it over.

### Initial Thoughts
Initially I was thinking that I would trade crypto currencies, specifically the ones that are less than a dollar each. I got a list from Coinomi and supported by Shapeshift's trade. But then I later realized after working with Block.io that I'm actually limited to Block.io's wallet. So I can only trade between LTC/Dogecoin. Dogecoin is the one that is less than a dollar each but I'm using LTC as my parent fund.

So at this time after building the first version that can trade using both Shapeshift and BlockIO, I'm not sure what to do.
