My attempts at automated altcoin trading

## Please note:
It is important to get the target wallet address correct, not only in that the wallet string exists, but that 
it's also the same type of crypto currency. I've already wasted just over $2 when I sent Reddcoin into a Litecoin wallet on
accident.

## Also note:
I'm not an expert, this is code that you should not trust/use without looking it over.
